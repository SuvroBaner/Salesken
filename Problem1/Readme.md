The file <a href= "./Exhaustive Search.ipynb">Exhaustive Search.ipynb</a> uses Levenshtein edit-distance between two city name of the same country, this is an exhaustive search approach.<br>

In the file<a href="./Spell Checking.ipynb" Spell Checking.ipynb </a>, i try to form the correct word using the list of correct words, by modifying the Misspelt city name by deleting, inserting or replacing characters at each split position of the word.<br>
This approach appears to be slower than the Exhaustive Search approach, maybe using better data structures can speed-up the solution.
